LINE instant messenger protocol
===============================

I moved this to its own repository for clarity.

Files:

* **line.thrift**: a hopefully complete Apache Thrift interface file for the protocol
* **line-protocol.md**: the rest of the implementation details and notes that should be sufficient to implement a client
